## 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension
Welcome to the 0x02 project on Python Asynchronous Comprehension! This project is designed to help you learn and apply concepts related to asynchronous programming and comprehensions in Python.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating and working with asynchronous generators and comprehensions. By the end of the project, you should be able to:
1. Write an asynchronous generator.
2. Use async comprehensions.
3. Type-annotate generators.

## Resources
To get started, you should review the following resources:
- PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions
- What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators
- Type-hints for Generators

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain how to write an asynchronous generator.
- Demonstrate how to use async comprehensions.
- Understand how to type-annotate generators.
