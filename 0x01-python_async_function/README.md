## 0x01. Python - Async
Welcome to the Python Async project! This project is a hands-on learning experience focused on asynchronous programming in Python. By the end of this project, you'll have a solid understanding of async/await syntax, coroutine execution, and concurrency in Python.

## Project Focus:
Python Asynchronous Programming
asyncio module
Concurrent coroutines
Random delays

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the async and await syntax.
- Execute an async program using asyncio.
- Run concurrent coroutines and manage their execution.
- Create asyncio tasks and handle their results.
- Utilize the random module for generating random values.
